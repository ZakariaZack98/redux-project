Here's a great small project idea that will thoroughly test your understanding of **Redux Toolkit** while keeping the scope manageable:

---

### ðŸ”„ **Multi-Step Form Wizard with Redux Toolkit**

#### ðŸ“‹ Overview:

Create a multi-step form (like a registration or checkout process) where each step collects different data from the user. Use **Redux Toolkit** to manage form state globally across all steps.

---

### ðŸ§  Concepts Youâ€™ll Practice:

* `createSlice` for form state management
* `configureStore` for setting up Redux Toolkit
* Using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` with React components
* Form validation and conditional rendering
* Saving progress (optionally, localStorage or sessionStorage)
* Optional: Async thunk for "submitting" the form data (simulate an API call)

---

### ðŸ›  Features:

* Step 1: User Info (name, email)
* Step 2: Address Info (address, city, zip)
* Step 3: Preferences (checkboxes, dropdowns)
* Final Step: Review and Submit
* Navigation buttons: Next, Back, Submit
* Display current form data from Redux store on a summary page

---

### âœ… Bonus Challenges (Optional):

* Add field-level validation using a library like `yup` or write custom validators
* Use `createAsyncThunk` to simulate API submission with loading & success state
* Save the form progress in localStorage so a refresh doesnâ€™t lose the data
* Add a progress bar based on the current step
